## Code Style

We have adopted [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) as the primary style guide.

We have a `.php_cs` configuration file for [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)

We have also established a few style guidelines we strive for:

* Four space indention
* Methods, Properties, and Variables should be camelCase
* Short array syntax
* K&R braces (including elseif/else)
* Chained method calls should be indented
* See [Our Style Discussion](https://github.com/phergie/phergie-irc-bot-react/issues/20) For more.
